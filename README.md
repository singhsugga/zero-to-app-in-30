# Zero to app in 30m with AngularFire

Angular together with Firebase makes a potent combination. [Jamie Perkins](https://github.com/inorganik)' presentation shows how to create a production-ready app using these tools in only a half hour. This project only scratches the surface of Firebase, but demonstrates:

- Setting up authentication
- Make an auth guard to protect routes
- Make use of avatars
- Read and write Firestore data

And as a bonus, you'll get to know Angular google maps. Later in your project, you can take advantage of cloud storage, cloud functions, and everything else Firebase has to offer.

### Production example

If you're wondering what a real-world AngularFire app looks like, check out [Podmap](https://github.com/inorganik/podmap), an open-source app I built to map the world's podcasts.

### Getting started

To run this project locally, you'll need to [create a new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and get a [Google maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-backend.googleapis.com).

Create an environment.ts file from the provided sample file and replace the keys.

Build and run locally:

```shell
$ ng s
```

### Init Firebase package

First, globally install firebase tools:
```sh
$ npm i -g firebase-tools
```
Login to firebase:
```sh
$ firebase login
```
Build the app for prod so you can test deployment:
```sh
$ ng build --prod
```
You can init and re-init any time. The `init` command makes it easy to configure firebase.
  - For now, only choose hosting when prompted for what to configure locally.
  - Configure as an SPA? - Yes.
  - For serve folder, choose `dist/project-name`
```sh
$ firebase init 
```
Deploy. Your app will be instantly hosted and accessible at the provided url.
```sh
$ firebase deploy
```

### AngularFire snippets

Here are some code snippets that took me a bit of trial and error. They aren't used in the project so I included them here for reference using a generic model "Entity":

#### Firebase get or else

```ts
getOrElse(entity: Entity): Promise<Entity | any> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    this.afs.doc<Entity>(docPath).valueChanges().pipe(
      first()
    ).toPromise()
      .then(result => {
        if (result === undefined) {
          // not found - this is the "else"
          // do stuff here or just reject
          reject('document does not exist');
        } else {
          resolve(result);
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => reject(err));
  }
}
```

#### Firebase upsert

```ts
addOrUpdate(entity: Entity): Promise<any> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const docPath = `entities/${entity.id}`;
    // try to update first
    this.afs.doc(docPath).update(entity)
      .then(() => resolve())
      .catch(() => {
        // doc doesn't exist, add
        this.afs.doc(docPath).set(entity)
          .then(() => resolve())
          .catch(err => reject(err));
      });
    });
}
```
